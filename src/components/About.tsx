              <p>
                Hope Foundation was born from a simple but powerful belief: every person deserves 
                a second chance. Founded in 2019, we started as a small community initiative to 
                help homeless youth in our local area.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we witnessed the complex challenges facing vulnerable populations, we expanded 
                our mission to include comprehensive rehabilitation services and educational support. 
                Today, we serve hundreds of individuals annually through our integrated approach 
                to healing and empowerment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our work is guided by the understanding that sustainable change requires addressing 
                root causes, not just symptoms. Through therapy, education, and practical support, 
                we help people rebuild their lives from the ground up.
